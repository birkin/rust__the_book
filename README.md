### Notes from ["The (rust) Book"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/title-page.html)

---

- if i want to have a 'code' and 'binaries' directory in the 'stuff_dir', and I'm in 'code', I can compile with:

        $ rustc --out-dir ../binaries/ ./hello_world.rs

- cargo

    - nice, outputs to a separate directory

    - i like that `cargo check` can check without auto-compiling

    - i like that `cargo run` can compile-_and_-build

    - so cool...

            $ cargo doc --open
